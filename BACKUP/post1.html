    <p>"How are you enjoying the war?" asked my boss with a big grin and a chuckle.  What war?  On the streets and beaches of Tel Aviv, it seemed to be business as usual: dog walkers, people watchers, and dedicated joggers.  Less than 40 miles south of Tel Aviv, in cities like Ashkelon, Ashdod, and Be'er Sheva, a very different reality was setting in.  Over 85 rockets had been fired into Southern Israeli cities by Hamas on July 7th from Gaza.  The barrage would not go unanswered.  By the morning of July 8th, Operation Protective Edge was in full swing.  The past few weeks have been an incredibly unique experience, full of insightful conversations, new friendships, and meaningful connections.</p>
    <p>When I first told my parents about the trip, they were reluctant.  "Why don't you find something in D.C. or New York?"  They, like many Americans, were all too familiar with recent media coverage.  In a similar vein, Israelis often ask me "Why did you choose Israel?" The answer has two parts.  The first is my passion for entrepreneurship.  Israel is known as "Startup Nation," with the most number of startups per capita and about 3% of their GDP attributed solely to startups (as of 2000).  Foreign investment, talented engineers, and a thriving entrepreneurial culture create a powerhouse for technological innovation.  The second part is a sense of wanderlust.  I believe it is essential to explore, travel, meet new people, and experience different cultures.  I must have told my parents, "It will be fine, I can take care of myself" several hundred times before the trip.  In all honesty, as I was sitting at the gate in Frankfurt waiting to board my connecting flight to Tel Aviv, there were some nerves.  It is so important, especially in today's global economy, to be comfortable with being uncomfortable.</p>
